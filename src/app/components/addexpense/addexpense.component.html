  <p>Both components and services are simply classes, with decorators that mark their type and
  provide metadata that tells Angular how to use them.</p>

  <p>The metadata for a component class associates it with a template that defines a view. A
  template combines ordinary HTML with Angular directives and binding markup that allow Angular
  to modify the HTML before rendering it for display.</p>

  <p>The metadata for a service class provides the information Angular needs to make it available
  to components through Dependency Injection (DI).</p>

  <p>An app's components typically define many views, arranged hierarchically. Angular provides
  the Router service to help you define navigation paths among views. The router provides
  sophisticated in-browser navigational capabilities.</p>
